Graham's special paradox of mathematics and investment
--------------------------------------------

As a physicist, I support the skillful application of mathematics.
In these notes, we have used some calculus, linear algebra, and numerical
optimizations.

Still, noting Graham:

>   [T]here is a special paradox in the relationship between mathematics and
>   investment attitudes on common stocks, which is this: Mathematics is
>   ordinarily considered as producing precise and dependable results;
>   but in the stock market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics
>   the more uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.
>   In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study I have never seen
>   dependable calculations made about common stock values, or related
>   investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
>   elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra,
>   you could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to
>   substitute theory for experience, and usually also to give to speculation
>   the deceptive guise of investment. [^Graham2003p570]
